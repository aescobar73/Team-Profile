## Description

        The following Challenge requires us to generate a Team Profile that consist of:
        - Manager
        - Engineer
        - Intern

        Then after creating a profile for each member they would be added to an html file that was created using the user input.

        Classes were created so that we may run tests and make sure our functions were working correctly before being deployed.
